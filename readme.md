# Object oriented programming [Programowanie obiektowe]

Object oriented programming course at AGH University of Science and Technology.  
Repo contains my solutions to exercises posted on 
[this page](http://home.agh.edu.pl/~pszwed/wiki/doku.php?id=programowanie_obiektowe) 
[exercises in Polish]  

Labs thematic scope:
1. Introduction (compilation, IDE)
2. Classes (Matrix class)
3. Unit tests (Matrix class unit tests)
4. Relations between objects (CV generator)
5. Abstract classes (Simple derivative calculator)
6. Files handling and basics errors (CSV Reader)  
7. Java Collections (AdminUnitList)
8. Interfaces (AdminUnitList - continuation)
9. Lambda expressions (AdminUnitList - continuation)
10. Threads (Clock)

Labs focus more on object oriented programming in java than object oriented programing as a paradigm. 
That's because previous course, which was named 'programming languages and methods II', contained object oriented programming.
