# Object oriented programming [Programowanie obiektowe]

Object oriented programming course at AGH University of Science and Technology.  
Repo contains my solutions to exercises posted on 
[this page](http://home.agh.edu.pl/~pszwed/wiki/doku.php?id=programowanie_obiektowe) 
[exercises in Polish]  

Labs thematic scope:
* [1] Introduction (compilation, IDE)
* [2] Classes (Matrix class)
* [3] Unit test (Matrix class unit test)
* [4] Relations between objects (CV generator)
* [5] 
* [6] Files handling and basics errors (CSV Reader)

Labs focus more on object oriented programming in java than object oriented programing as a paradigm. 
That's because previous course, which was named 'programming languages and methods II', contained object oriented programming.
